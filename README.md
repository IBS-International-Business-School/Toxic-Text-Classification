# Toxic-Text-Classification


The spread of toxic content on the web sid has now turned into a severe issue for digital platforms
and communities. This kind of toxic language e.g.; hate speech, threats, insult, and identity-based
attacks can set up adversarial environments and lead to severe psychological traumas to the people
(Fortuna and Nunes, 2018). With the further expansion of online communication around the world,
the volume of produced user generated content has grown exponentially making the manual
moderation impossible and requiring the use of automatic detection methods (Schmidt and
Wiegand, 2017).
This research addresses the development and comparison of automatic methods for identifying
toxic content based on computational algorithms. In particular, we analyze common machine
learning methods, modern neural methods, and information retrieval systems to overcome this
issue. By developing improved toxic content detection systems, platforms enhance protection of
users as well as nurture the growth of healthier online environments (Vidgen et al., 2019).

# Research Objectives

The primary objectives of this research are:

    1. To evaluate the effectiveness of classical machine learning, neural networks, and prompt-
         based approaches for toxic content classification

    2. To develop and compare TF-IDF, neural embedding, and hybrid search engines for
         retrieving toxic content

    3. To analyze model performance across different types of toxicity (general toxicity, severe
         toxicity, obscenity, threats, insults, and identity-based hate)

    4. To identify strengths and limitations of different approaches to inform future development
         of toxicity detection systems

                                                                                                                              4
# Significance and Applications

Effective toxicity detection systems have numerous practical applications:

    • Content moderation: Assisting human moderators by automatically flagging potentially
         harmful content for review

    • User protection: Filtering or warning users about potentially distressing content
    • Research: Enabling quantitative analysis of toxic content patterns across platforms
    • Educational tools: Helping users identify and avoid using harmful language
    • Community management: Supporting the enforcement of community guidelines

The insights gained from this research contribute to the broader field of natural language
processing and specifically to the development of safer online spaces.
